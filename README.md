# Work Schedule Management

This app is a day scheduler that enables users to save events for each hour of the day between 8am and 5pm. It utilizes JQuery for its functionality. The primary goal of this app is to help users organize and plan their day effectively. By allowing users to input and remember their daily activities, this app provides a sense of order and organization, and eliminates the chaos that can result from trying to keep track of everything. Through the process of building this app, I gained experience using JQuery to target elements in the past, present, and future using the time function.
